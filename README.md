# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning and LSTM

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using various machine learning models and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The primary goal is to compare different regression models and select the best one for predicting future stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices by:
1. Applying different machine learning models using the `LazyPredict` library to find the best performing model.
2. Implementing an LSTM model for time series prediction.
3. Comparing and evaluating the models based on various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of stock prices with the following columns:
- **Ticker**: Stock symbol.
- **Date/Time**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **Open**: Opening price.
- **High**: Highest price during the time period.
- **Low**: Lowest price during the time period.
- **Close**: Closing price.
- **Volume**: Trading volume.
- **Open Interest**: Number of outstanding contracts.

### Dataset Example:
